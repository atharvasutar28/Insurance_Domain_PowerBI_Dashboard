# Insurance_Domain_PowerBI_Dashboard
## Project Overview
This report focuses on understanding the companyâ€™s customer base and revenue generation, tracking daily growth rates, and monitoring month-over-month policy changes to identify trends and improvement areas.

## Importing Data into PowerBi
* As the datasets are in CSV format, so I imported the datasets from Excel to PowerBi by using Power Query.
## Data Model
* Data modeling plays a vital role and is considered as the basement of the report. All the visuals will be built upon the data model.
* Poor data modeling affects the overall performance of the report.
* Following Good practices of data modeling is a must. Refer to this page to get to know the good practices of Blog
* In this project, we have followed the Snowflake data modeling schema.
